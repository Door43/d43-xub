  * **You man of little faith** - This may also be translated as, "You have so little faith in me!" or, "You do not trust me very much!"
  * **why did you doubt?** - That is, "You should not have doubted me!" or, "You should have trusted me completely." This isn't a real question, but a way in this language to make a strong point. In many languages, it works better to express this as a statement.
